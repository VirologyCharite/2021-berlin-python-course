# Talking about homework from day 2

Here are my word-counts homework scripts that we discussed and improved in the course this morning:


* word-counts-all-highest-v1.py is the script I made at home that outputs all most common words or the most common in case there is only one with the highest count and that is sensitive for case

* We improved the script by including the generation of a set in the forward loop, elif, and .pop(). The improved script is word-counts-all-highest-v2.py

* word-counts-all-highest-lowcase-v2 is the improved version of the case-insensitive script (that additionally contains a step that converst all letters to lower case)


I try to upload this in github. I hope it works...
