# Homework

Make some changes to the `sequence-match.py` program:

* How often does the pattern occur in the sequence?
* At what position(s) does the pattern occur in the sequence?
* Check that the sequence is all A, C, G, or T letters, and give an error if not.
* Matching with up to some count of mismatches (Bonus question!)
* Make the program ignore case.
* Write a new program that reads one sequence from standard input and then allows the user to enter a series of patterns.
* Give an error if the sequence or the pattern is empty.
